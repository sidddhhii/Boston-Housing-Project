# Boston Housing Project
# Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques. We employ a dataset containing various attributes of houses in Boston suburbs to build and evaluate predictive models.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. This dataset was originally provided by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. in 1978.

# Features
The dataset includes the following features:

- CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's (target variable)

# Methods Used
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Polynomial Features, Interaction Features, Transformation)
- Model Building (Linear Regression)
- Model Evaluation (Mean Squared Error, R-squared Score)
- Visualization (Scatter Plots)

# Results
- The project demonstrates the application of linear regression models to predict housing prices based on various features.
- Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score are used to assess model performance.
- Visualizations are provided to compare actual versus predicted housing prices using different feature sets.
